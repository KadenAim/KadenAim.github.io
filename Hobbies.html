                <dd>
                    I've been running for about 4 years now and it's something that I find joy in. It's important to me
                    because it has been a big part of my life from middle to highschool. I spend a lot of time
                    getting better in practice, out of practice, and during my off seasons. I've also made many
                    cherishable friends because of it.

                <dt class="dthead">Lifting</dt>
                <dd>
                    Lifting is another hobby I enjoy. I first started lifting when I was 12 and have grown to love it
                    over the years. It's important to me because it's a way for me to spend time with my father and
                    brother and make new, lasting memories with them. We also go out to eat after and spend more time
                    together. In addition, it acts as a therapy for me, helping me get rid of some stress and improving
                    my mood.

                <dt class="dthead">Going Out</dt>
                <dd>
                    Going out with friends and family is also very important to me because it's fun, I get to try new
                    foods, and I get to make more memories with them.
                    They are the people I can go to for help and to have fun so being able to go out with them is
                    important. I also like to eat good food, which adds to the joy.
