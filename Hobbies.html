            <dt class="hobbies">Weight Training</dt>
            <dd>I was introduced to the weightroom by my father and brother when I was 12 years old. It's a fun weekend
                activity that we do and a lot of joy has come out of it.
            <dd>Some of my favorite exercises include:
            </dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Dumbell press</li>
                <li>Cable rows</li>
                <li>Lat pulldown</li>
                <li>Squat</li>
                <li>Preacher curls</li>
            </ul>
            <dt class="hobbies">Running</dt>
            <dd> Since middle school, running has become a major part of my life, and although many don't enjoy this
                form of cardio, I've come to love it. I have been running everyday for a couple months now and I plan on keeping
                my stride going.</dd>
