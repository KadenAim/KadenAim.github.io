                    Sports and School...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Skipping over preschool, the first elementry school I attended was Pauoa Elementary for kindergarten. Although, due to the new birth month rule, I had to repeat the same grade because I was late born so my parents decided to move me to Soto Academy, which was next to
                    Kawananakoa. I stayed there from kindergarten to third grade before moving to Hawaii Baptist
                    Academy, across the street. During my time in elementary school, I tried playing baseball and
                    soccer, but fell short compared to my teammates so I decided to quit and try something else. That's
                    when I found tennis and played in a small club for around two years before middle school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I continued to be a student at HBA during middle school, which I am thankful for because it gave me
                    the opportunity to participate in an intermediate level of sports. My brother did cross country and
                    track during highschool. My dad also did track so I decided that I'd also give it a try. Joining the
                    team would mark the beginning of the journey that I continue embarking on today. I also decided to
                    do tennis my seventh grade year, winning D2 intermediate champs, but I wanted to focus on running so I quit. I made a lot of new
                    friends through the sport and quickly fell in love with it, wanting to push myself even harder.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    As my time at HBA continued, I started to feel an urge to change schools so I decided to give Roosevelt a try. It was definitely a new atmosphere, which took some time to aclimate to,
                    but I was able to make connections with new teachers and students, making my school life a lot more
                    fun. I continue to run on the XC and track team here, and I was blessed enough to meet some amazing coaches
                    who continuesly push my capabilities. Running has continued to be a fun passion of mine so I plan on
                    sticking it out until I graduate. I hope to enjoy my time at this school until I graduate and put some good times under my belt.
